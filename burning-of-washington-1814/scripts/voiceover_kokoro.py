"""Burning of Washington 1814 narration: Kokoro-82M ONNX, deep American male (am_michael/am_onyx blend).

    python scripts/voiceover_kokoro.py <kokoro_dir> [--whisper]

<kokoro_dir> holds model.onnx and am_michael.bin / am_onyx.bin from
huggingface.co/onnx-community/Kokoro-82M-v1.0-ONNX. Synthesizes the script phrase by phrase with
deliberate dramatic pauses, then (with --whisper) gets word timestamps from faster-whisper so the
on-screen captions follow the voice word by word.

Writes public/audio/voiceover.wav + voiceover.mp3 and src/timeline.json
(phrases with start/end seconds, scene ids, and word timings).
